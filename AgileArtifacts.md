## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
Finding the problem of why the pause and unpause button dont work properly, tried the solution that Mr Jones gave it ended up looping the app instead. Adding the service worker and getting the notification to work on Android.
### What did you do well
Figuring out the issue and solving them in a way that I understood how 
### What will you do differently next time
Maybe try to get the notification to pop up on the screen instead of notification bar
