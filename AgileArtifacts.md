## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
The challenges I faced in this sprint was the page unsuccesfully deploying in the GitHub page and setting up the SQL databases again. Though I overcame with the helps of some classmates and pre-written documentation on how to set up the SQL database. 

### What did you do well
I think I did well with the sprint was making sure that the application was still working after I moved it to a new folder for the SQL database. 

### What will you do differently next time
What I would do differently next time would be to create the database first then build of it later
