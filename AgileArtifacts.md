## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
There wasnt mainly challenges in this sprint however there were many asepect that I had to go over multiple times to fixes such as the layout. Such as optimising the clock and date function on the timer and study planner pages. 
### What did you do well
I think I did well with this sprint was the layout of the study planner page as it is simple and understandable. 
### What will you do differently next time
I think I would do this at the beginning when I building all the pages' layout instead of being its own seperate sprint.
