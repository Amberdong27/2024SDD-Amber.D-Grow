# Agile Artifacts 

## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
- Database for the study tips was created 
- Constructed a front end JSON file for the tips 
- Generate cards for each tip 
- Dropdown Selector can display correct tip card for corresponding tip 
- No major changes was made


## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
- ~~Create database for study tips~~
- ~~JS to construct front end JSON file~~


## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
The challenge I face during this sprint was figuring out how to pull the data from the database to the front of my project. 
### What did you do well
Though some trial and error and taking breaks I was able to figure out a method to port the data from the database to the front end and assign each one to its corresponding option. 
### What will you do differently next time
I would definetely find a better way to port the data as the method I have used is not suitable more information as it would cause the user to have to continuously scroll down until they found the correct one.
