## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
- The main challenge was probably organising the user documentation so its easier for the user to understand
### What did you do well
- I think I did the dropdown menu well as it can seamlessly switch between different options 
### What will you do differently next time
- Perhaps styling it slightly better than what I have right now
