## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
Trying to figure out how I would improve the layout as ideas come and go and implementing them in the application. Maded the mistake of doing to much in the sprint such as coding the timer function (for next sprint).
### What did you do well
I think I did well with the layout of the page and the changing graphics. 

### What will you do differently next time
Next time I would try focus on only the aspect and not over think things
