# Agile Artifacts 

## Sprint backlog list of achievables (annotate changes made during sprint, including data required)
- ~~Trying to make a function timer~~
- ~~Working Unpause and Pause buttons~~
- ~~Adding Notification API~~ (if possible)
- ~~Adding a warning sound before timer ends~~ (if possible)

Notes: 
- Shared UAT doc with Timer Page

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
- Building the timer function 


## Sprint Review 
### What challenges did you have
The challenges I faced during this sprint was mainly trying to get the timer to be displayed correctly and can count down properly after it has been paused. Another challenge was getting the time to calculate correct as during the sprint I ran into one error after another 
### What did you do well
 I think I did well with updating the UI to suit the timer better as well as building the timer and the pause and unpause button functions.

### What will you do differently next time
What I would do differently next time would be to perhaps simplify and condense the code more.
